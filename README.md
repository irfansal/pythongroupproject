# pythongroupproject
A group project designed to create a class registration system.

In this project, I have demonstrated the abilities to:
- Work in teams to create Python programs
- Create modules and functions
- Pass data from one function to another
- Store data in lists and dictionaries
- Create and use selection control structures
- Create and use iterative control structures
- Add comments to Python code

This program creates a class registration system.  Students log into the class registration system and then they can add courses, drop courses, and list the courses for which they have registered.
This program has 7 functions in 3 modules: a student module, a billing module, and a main module.

The project was split between me and two other individuals. I was in charge of creating the billing module.
